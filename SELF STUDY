# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE
Software devcelpment life cycle (SDLC) is a standard process followed by the software industry. It initiate` distinctive phases to create a software product based on client requirement. Crucial phases in software development life cycle includes the following below:
1. Planning Phase: This is the phase where the developers and the client discuss about basic software requirements, which include purpose of the application, key element like format and software attributes, and overall user interface design.
2. Requirement Analysis Phase: This phase include the detailed information about each element in the software requirement. The installation of element in the application according to the client requirement, calibrating the security protocol and risk analysis, and all details discussed would be filed in the software requirement specification document (SRS)
3. Design Phase: The software designers would devise the system design following the SRS document, check feasibility with requirement, and all details of the design phase are added to the design document specification (DDS Document)
4. Implementation Phase: In this phase, the developer start writing the code using the language they choose for the software development. It encapsulate the actual implementation of the software product.
5. Testing Phase: The developed software is deployed in multiple test enviroment to check the functionality. Testing team may find error or bugs in software which would be forwarded to the developer team for debugging.
6. Deployment Phase: The development team would set up installation link for the users, fix bugs, debugging of the regular application is done on regular basis, and regular updates with enhanced features for better performance and user experience.

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT MODELS
Software development models are frameworks used by software development teams to structure, plan, and control the process of developing software. These models provide a systematic approach to building software, ensuring efficiency, quality, and adherence to requirements. Here are some common software development models:
1. Waterfall Model: In this sequential model, each phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC) is completed before moving on to the next one. It follows a linear approach, starting from requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is completed.
2. Agile Model: Agile methodologies, including Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. Agile teams work in short cycles called sprints, delivering working software incrementally. Customer feedback is integrated regularly, allowing for quick adjustments and improvements.
3. Iterative Model: Similar to Agile, the Iterative model breaks down the software development process into smaller cycles or iterations. Each iteration produces a partial version of the software, which is refined and expanded in subsequent iterations based on feedback and evolving requirements.
4. Spiral Model: The Spiral model combines elements of both the Waterfall and Iterative models. It emphasizes risk management by dividing the project into small cycles, each involving planning, risk analysis, development, and customer evaluation. It is particularly suitable for large, complex projects with evolving requirements.
5. V-Model: The V-Model is an extension of the Waterfall model that emphasizes the relationship between each phase of development and its corresponding testing phase. It emphasizes the importance of testing throughout the development life cycle, with testing activities mirroring development activities in a sequential manner.
6. DevOps Model: DevOps is a culture, philosophy, and set of practices that aim to improve collaboration between development and operations teams. It emphasizes automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and rapid feedback loops to enable faster and more reliable software delivery.
7. Lean Software Development: Inspired by Lean manufacturing principles, Lean software development focuses on delivering value to customers while minimizing waste. It emphasizes principles such as optimizing the whole, eliminating delays, empowering teams, and continuously improving processes.
8. Hybrid Models: Many software development teams adopt hybrid approaches, combining elements of multiple models to suit their specific needs and project requirements. For example, a team might use Agile practices for development while following a V-Model approach for testing and validation.

Each software development model has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of model depends on factors such as project size, complexity, team capabilities, customer requirements, and industry standards.


## CHMOD AND CHOWN LINUX COMMAND
1. Chown command is used to change the ownership of the files and directories
2. chmod command allow user to change permission of a file or directory by specifying who can read, write or execute it.
3. Ownership: Every file and directories in linux has an owner and group associated with it. The owner has certain permission to read, write, and execute the file, and so does the group associated with the file.
4. Permission: Permission control who can read, write, or execute files and directories. There are three set of permissions; one for the owner of the file, one for the group associated with the file, and one for everyone.



 ## TCP (TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL) AND UDP (USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL)
1. Transmission control protcol is a connection oriented protocol. Meaning it establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. It provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets
2. User datagram protocol is a connectionless protocol, meaning it does not establish connection before sending data. It provides unreliable, unordered, and unchecked delivery data packets.. It is commonly used for applications where speed is more important than reliability, such as real time audio, video streaming, and online gaming e.t.c


## MOST COMMON USED PROTOCOL ASSOCIATED WITH TCP AND UDP IN WEB APPLICATION
### TCP (TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL)
1. HTTP (Hypertext tranfer protocol): is the foundation of communication on the world wide web, used for transferring web pages and other resources from a server to client browser
2. HTTPS (Hypertext transfer protocol secure): is similar to HTTP but encrypted to secure communication, commonly used for online transaction, and sensitive data exchange.
3. SSH (secure shell): A cryptographic network protocol used for secure remote login and command execution on remote computers
4. FTP (file transfer protocol): A standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network
5. SFTP (ssh file transfer protocol): A secure file transfer protocol that provide file access, tranfer and management functionalities over ssh


### UDP (USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL)
1. DNS (Domain name system): A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet, translating domain name into IP addresses
2. DCHP (Dynamic host Configuration protocol): A network management protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameter to devices on a network
3. SNMP (Simple network management protocol): A protocol used for network management and monitoring network attached services
4. TFTP (Transfer file transfer protocol): A simplified version of FTP, commonly used for transferring small files between a client and a server.
